# The Incredible Train Scheduling Machine
### Find out when the next train is arriving!

Create your own train route and the app will tell you when the next train is scheduled to arrive. 

You must specify the following:
* name of the train
* destination of the train
* time the first train departed
* frequency of the train

Upon hitting the "Submit" button, the app will display the results at the top of the list. All historical train routes created are listed in sequence below, with the newest train route at the top and the oldest at the bottom.

Enjoy!
